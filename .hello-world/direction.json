  "vision": "The deliberation room is the external prototype for what the brain system should do natively. When facing a significant decision, the brain engine runs it through multiple cognitive modes in parallel (Contrarian, Pre-mortem, First Principles, Steelman, Analogist, Constraint), surfaces the tensions, then synthesizes. Right now Pat triggers deliberations manually. The long-term target: the system detects decision points automatically and runs internal deliberation before surfacing a recommendation. The human cognitive architecture epic and the deliberation room are the same feature â€” one internal, one external.",
