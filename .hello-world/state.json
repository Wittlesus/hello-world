Root cause: get_app_project_path() (lib.rs:101) reads from the JSON config unconditionally. set_app_project_path() (lib.rs:109) only gets called from the Settings UI. The app never checks std::env::current_dir() on startup. Fix: On Tauri app init, check if CWD contains a .hello-world/ directory. If yes, use CWD as projectPath and update the config file. If no, fall back to the stored config. This ensures launching from a project directory always wins over stale config. Related: t_mp_mcp_fix, t_mp_switcher.",
