Personal legal sounds obvious until you ask: why hasn't a 2-person startup solved \"explain contracts to individuals\" when thousands of indie devs have built contract templates? The answer usually isn't that the market is untapped—it's that the unit economics don't work at consumer prices, or the liability is brutal. Local coordination sounds right until you realize the moat isn't network effects, it's trust, and trust doesn't scale from neighborhood to neighborhood without active moderation that eats margins. Skill verification is the one worth pressing on: the real gap isn't credentials, it's that meaningful assessment requires domain expertise (you can't automate \"does this person actually know design\"?), so the question becomes whether we can build an incentive structure where domain experts do the assessment work for us. The constraint we should actually focus on is: what can we charge for that a customer will pay monthly, where the solution genuinely becomes more valuable with time, and where we don't need thousands of users to break even?",

The moment you try to serve \"Gen Z\" or \"freelancers\" broadly, you're competing head-to-head against VC-backed products with 50x your resources. The second thing: we're hunting in categories (pet tech, personal legal, audio tools) that are obviously underserved precisely because they've been evaluated and rejected by funded companies for real reasons—usually unit economics or liability.

Do we know 5 freelancers in construction, or folks running rental properties, or a Discord community of small creators dealing with the same repetitive admin task? That's where the moat lives—not in the product, in the fact that we can get our first 10 customers without paying for ads. Once we answer that, the feature set writes itself because we're literally building for people we talk to every week.

      "text": "The deeper question isn't \"is this calculator right\" -- it's \"can we build a reliable process for KEEPING it right?\" Any tax calculator is only as good as its last update. If we can't commit to verifying against IRS publications and state energy office data quarterly, we're shipping a time bomb. The real moat play: be the site that updates fastest when legislation changes. OBBBA just passed -- most sites haven't updated. That's a window. But it's a window that requires ongoing maintenance, not a build-and-forget product.",

      "text": "From an adoption angle: the lease vs buy framing is genius for consumer appeal. That's the actual decision homeowners are making right now. Most solar sites push you toward their own product. A neutral calculator that shows \"here's what leasing saves you, here's what buying saves you, here's the law\" builds trust instantly. The angle against EnergySage: they're a marketplace. They want to sell you a quote. TaxCreditCalculators.com is the neutral advisor -- no skin in the game. That positioning is the differentiator.",

Two findings: (1) The tax law in the calculator is CONFIRMED CORRECT -- Section 25D expired end of 2025, Section 48E still active for leases with July 4 2026 construction deadline.

(2) Competitive landscape: EnergySage, SolarReviews, Solar.com cover this editorially but no one has a clean, neutral lease-vs-buy interactive calculator specifically for post-OBBBA.

Tax law data verified correct (Section 25D expired, 48E active for leases, July 4 2026 safe harbor deadline). Competitive gap confirmed -- no clean neutral interactive calculator exists for post-OBBBA decisions. Business model: free interactive calculators + SEO content + solar installer/CPA lead gen referrals ($50-200/lead). Moat: domain authority + interactive complexity AI overviews can't replicate + fastest updates when legislation changes. Key risks: Google AI overviews eating simple queries (mitigate with branching multi-step tools), credits can be legislated away (mitigate by expanding to all credit types as a platform). Immediate next steps: (1) verify all 50 state credit amounts against DSIRE database, (2) redesign the calculator with modern clean UI, (3) deploy to the domain, (4) write supporting SEO content targeting \"solar lease vs buy 2026\" keywords, (5) set up referral partnerships with solar installers.",
