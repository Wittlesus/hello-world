By that test: Timeline and Sessions are the same thing — both are \"what happened in the past, in order.\" Sessions is a list of Claude sessions; Timeline is a log of events. Merge them into one \"History\" tab under Brain. Agents under Tasks is also suspect — Agents are not a task artifact, they're a Brain artifact (they ARE Claude's cognitive components). Cut Agents from Tasks, move to Brain. Questions and Decisions both belong under Tasks but could merge into one \"Log\" tab since both are read-heavy reference views.",

They have completely different interaction patterns — Decisions are append-only architecture records you reference, Questions are open items that need answering and get resolved. Combining them into a \"Log\" makes both harder to use because neither dominates. Keep them separate. The real cut candidate is Watchers — it's a developer-facing internal mechanism, not a user-facing view. Pat never opens Watchers to get value, he opens it to debug. That belongs in Settings or behind an advanced toggle, not as a peer subtab of Memory and Skills.",

In Git you never need a dedicated view for \"what refs exist\" — that's surfaced contextually. Sessions and Timeline are like git reflog — useful when debugging, not a primary view. Contrarian is right that Watchers is a reflog-equivalent: diagnostic, not navigational. What's missing from this map that Git has: a \"diff\" view — something that shows what changed between now and the last session. That's not Timeline (which is an event log), it's a delta summary. Could live as Dashboard's secondary panel.",

Probably never during normal operation, only when something is broken or when setting up a new capability. That's a Settings-tier tab, not a Brain-tier tab. If it stays in Brain, it becomes the tab that's always there but never visited, making Brain feel cluttered. Move Skills to Settings. What IS missing from Brain that would be visited regularly: a Memories tab that surfaces searchable pain/win/fact entries — currently Memory view exists but the name is vague and the interface probably needs work.",

Knowing Claude has the Stripe MCP server available is directly relevant when reading Memory or Context about what Claude has built. They're co-located for a reason. The real question is whether Skills needs to be a full tab at all — it might work better as a panel sidebar within Brain rather than a peer tab. Also: Agents under Tasks has a genuine steelman — you check on agents specifically while reviewing deliberation tasks. The deliberation panel IS a task artifact. Agents are task participants, not brain components, in this context.",
