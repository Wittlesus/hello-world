  "message": "## VERIFIED (done, tested, confirmed working)\n- TypeScript build: 0 errors across all 3 commits\n- Scan skill: upgraded with intelligence briefing + for/against assessment steps\n\n## MERGED BUT UNTESTED (code is on master, not yet tested in running app)\n- Brain wiring (86de364): auto-win disabled, surprise storage wired, learned rules in retrieval, deliberation verify exit(2)\n  - Test: store a pain memory, check activity.json for brain_prediction. If surprise detected, check memories.json for new 'surprise' tagged memory.\n  - Test: run hw_retrieve_memories with tags matching learned-rules.json. Output should include LEARNED RULES section.\n  - Test: mark a task done. NO \"Completed: X\" win memory should appear in memories.json.\n- Bible view (6ffc007): ClaudeMdView.tsx + get_claude_md Rust command, key B, Sidebar entry, edit intent feature\n  - Test: restart app, press B. Should see CLAUDE.md rendered as styled collapsible cards with icons.\n  - Test: click pencil icon on a section, type instruction, should switch to terminal and send message.\n- Skill memory type (fe7af58): 'skill' added to MemoryType, cyan badge in MemoryView, 90-day decay half-life\n  - Test: hw_store_memory with type:'skill'. Should appear in Memory view with cyan badge.\n\n## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST\n1. `git log --oneline -5` -> expect: fe7af58, 6ffc007, 86de364\n2. Restart app -> press B -> expect: styled CLAUDE.md viewer\n3. `npm run build:ts` -> expect: 0 errors\n4. hw_store_memory type:skill title:\"Test skill\" -> should succeed\n\n## WHAT NEEDS WORK NEXT\n1. Process 2 unread direction notes (autonomy directive + archive rule)\n2. Clean up bible-rust worktree\n3. Test all 3 features in running app after restart\n4. Add restart urgency levels to handoff format (soft/mild/urgent)\n\n## GIT STATE\n- master: fe7af58 -- feat: add 'skill' memory type for procedural knowledge\n- Worktrees: bible-rust at .claude/worktrees/bible-rust (can be cleaned)\n- Pending Rust changes: YES -- get_claude_md command needs restart to compile",
