Root cause: get_app_project_path() (lib.rs:101) reads from the JSON config unconditionally. set_app_project_path() (lib.rs:109) only gets called from the Settings UI. The app never checks std::env::current_dir() on startup. Fix: On Tauri app init, check if CWD contains a .hello-world/ directory. If yes, use CWD as projectPath and update the config file. If no, fall back to the stored config. This ensures launching from a project directory always wins over stale config. Related: t_mp_mcp_fix, t_mp_switcher.",

Shared polling: Replace per-hook 10s intervals in useTauriData.ts with a single global 30s heartbeat that deduplicates\n4. File watcher debounce: When MCP writes 3 files rapidly, batch the watcher events so components re-render once, not 3 times\n5. Verify all hooks work with split files: session-start, pre-tool-gate, user-prompt-submit, post-edit-context\n6. Test the full flow end-to-end\n\nThis is cleanup debt from the B+ state storage decision. Should have been caught during the original migration.",
