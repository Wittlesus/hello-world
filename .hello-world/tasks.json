      "description": "Pat's request: A menu (like the ? keybind help modal) showing all important /commands with descriptions. Clickable -- clicking a command auto-copies/pastes it into the terminal chat input. Commands to include: /fullsweep, /clean-quit, /commit, /review-pr, /content-pipeline:scan, /social-engine:engage, /pulse, /market-intel:research, /memory-gardener:garden, etc. Implementation: new CommandPalette component, triggered by a keybind (maybe /), lists commands with one-line descriptions, click handler writes to PTY stdin or copies to clipboard.",
