Multiple processes write to it concurrently (MCP server, Discord listener, file watcher). Race conditions can silently clobber data -- our mining agents confirmed this as a real pain point. We need to decide: do we patch the current system (file locking) or migrate to SQLite? And if SQLite, when and how? This affects every part of the system -- MCP server, Tauri app file watcher, session-start hook, all data reads.\n\nAgents: Backend Architect, Pragmatist, Contrarian, Security\n\nRationale: backendarch: owns the storage layer architecture, will propose migration paths. pragmatist: keeps us from over-engineering, weighs effort vs payoff. contrarian: challenges assumptions about both approaches. security: data integrity is fundamentally a safety concern.\n\nSub-questions (each must be addressed before synthesis):\n  1. Is the race condition actually causing data loss in practice, or is it theoretical? What evidence do we have?\n  2. File locking (quick fix) vs SQLite (proper fix) vs splitting state.json into separate files per concern -- which approach gives the best effort/payoff ratio RIGHT NOW?\n  3. If SQLite: how do we maintain the file-watcher reactivity pattern that powers live UI updates? SQLite changes don't emit filesystem events the same way JSON writes do.\n  4. If SQLite: what's the migration path? Big bang rewrite or incremental (one data type at a time)?\n  5. What happens to the session-start hook, which currently reads raw JSON files? Does it need to talk to SQLite directly or go through the MCP server?\n  6. Multi-project is coming (t_mp_epic). Does the storage decision change if each project has its own database vs shared global state?\n\nBalance assessment:\n  - Backend Architect: Risk: May over-architect toward SQLite because that's the 'proper' engineering answer, even if file locking solves the actual problem | Counter: Force concrete evidence of data loss before accepting migration. Ask: what specific bug does SQLite fix that locking doesn't?\n  - Contrarian: Risk: May reject SQLite reflexively just to be contrarian, even if it's clearly the right call | Counter: Require the contrarian to propose a specific alternative, not just criticize",
