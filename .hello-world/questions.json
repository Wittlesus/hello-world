      "question": "Should Hello World support multiple projects or just one at a time?",
      "context": "Currently the app is pointed at a single project path. Multi-project support would require a project switcher UI and separate data stores per project.",

      "createdAt": "2026-02-22T07:41:26.170Z",
      "answer": "One project at a time for now. The setup screen already handles project selection. Multi-project can come later if there's demand.",

      "question": "Should we add keyboard shortcuts to the Hello World desktop app?",
      "context": "Currently everything is mouse-driven. Power users might want hotkeys to switch views or trigger actions.",
      "status": "answered",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-22T07:43:47.529Z",
      "answer": "Yes — basic view-switching shortcuts (1-8 for each view) would be a quick win. Low effort, high power-user appeal.",

      "question": "Should the Settings view allow changing the project path without reinstalling?",
      "context": "Currently project path is set once on first launch. Changing it requires manual config edits.",
      "status": "answered",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-22T08:08:52.713Z",
      "answer": "Yes -- this is now part of the multi-project support epic. A proper project switcher will replace the current one-time setup. Settings will include project management.",
