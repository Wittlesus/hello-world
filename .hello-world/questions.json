      "answer": "Yes — basic view-switching shortcuts (1-8 for each view) would be a quick win. Low effort, high power-user appeal.",

Both add slash commands to .claude/commands/. The workflow: research -> spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement. Would replace our current ad-hoc task creation with structured specs. Could complement our existing deliberation system. Trade-off: more upfront overhead per feature, but less rework and better crash recovery (specs survive context loss).",

State storage was already decided (d_a9d3b3d7: split files + atomic writes, defer SQLite). Memory quality and knowledge intake could be implemented with a lightweight design pass instead of full deliberation, since the system is already functional and iterating fast.
