Pat flagged watchers as more trouble than worth for that use case (terminal flashing, per-task overhead). Discussion revealed the real value: crash recovery. A detached process that survives app crashes can backup state, write crash markers, and enable graceful recovery.\nChosen: Redesign watchers as a single persistent crash-safety sentinel spawned by buddy on startup. Hidden process (no console window), polls Tauri PID, runs recovery on crash/exit. Visual indicator on buddy shows sentinel health. Replaces dozens of per-task throwaway watchers with one always-on guardian.\nRationale: The sentinel survives crashes (detached process), is invisible to the user (windowsHide), and provides crash recovery that no in-process hook can offer. Buddy is the natural owner since it's the persistent visual element. For worktree Rust merges, manual file copy is simpler and more reliable.",

(3) Run it against real data (actual session transcript). (4) Score: what did it catch, what did it miss, what were false positives. (5) Iterate on the gaps. Different from parallel build (for known-scope work) and research sprints (for landscape mapping). This method is for when you're inventing something new.

(4) Groupthink check: Devil's Advocate was contrarian but shallow -- kept asserting things are \"fallbacks\" with no evidence. Pragmatist and Builder converged quickly.

      "content": "Pat's directive: (1) Remove session-end auto-pruning. (2) Pruning only triggers when memory count hits a capacity threshold -- like a storage gauge filling up. (3) Display memory usage as a visual bar in the app (same style as cost bars). (4) On /clean-quit, spawn an agent that reviews memories for: truly unnecessary entries, mistakes, duplicates. Agent uses judgment, not score cutoffs. (5) Memories get breathing room to prove their worth before any pruning happens. This replaces the current system where hw_end_session runs pruneMemories() automatically.",
      "rule": "Never auto-prune on session end. Pruning is capacity-triggered and agent-reviewed, not time-based and score-based.",
