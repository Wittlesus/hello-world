Pat flagged watchers as more trouble than worth for that use case (terminal flashing, per-task overhead). Discussion revealed the real value: crash recovery. A detached process that survives app crashes can backup state, write crash markers, and enable graceful recovery.\nChosen: Redesign watchers as a single persistent crash-safety sentinel spawned by buddy on startup. Hidden process (no console window), polls Tauri PID, runs recovery on crash/exit. Visual indicator on buddy shows sentinel health. Replaces dozens of per-task throwaway watchers with one always-on guardian.\nRationale: The sentinel survives crashes (detached process), is invisible to the user (windowsHide), and provides crash recovery that no in-process hook can offer. Buddy is the natural owner since it's the persistent visual element. For worktree Rust merges, manual file copy is simpler and more reliable.",
