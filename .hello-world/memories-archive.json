ENOENT fix: Find and update all references to the old state.json path (session-start hook, MCP server, Rust commands)\n2. Rust read cache: Add TTL-based file cache in lib.rs so multiple components reading the same file within 2-3s get cached results instead of hitting disk\n3. Shared polling: Replace per-hook 10s intervals in useTauriData.ts with a single global 30s heartbeat that deduplicates\n4. File watcher debounce: When MCP writes 3 files rapidly, batch the watcher events so components re-render once, not 3 times\n5. Verify all hooks work with split files: session-start, pre-tool-gate, user-prompt-submit, post-edit-context\n6. Test the full flow end-to-end\n\nThis is cleanup debt from the B+ state storage decision. Should have been caught during the original migration.",
