Results: (1) Did Qwen find anything Claude didn't? NO. No new bugs or issues surfaced. Devil's Advocate's \"state.json is a fail-safe\" claim was wrong -- it's genuinely a dead file read. (2) Did Qwen change priority ordering? PARTIALLY. Pragmatist's \"comment-out don't delete\" for brain engines is a reasonable middle ground Claude didn't propose. Builder pushed for \"verify before purge\" which is cautious but valid. (3) Was 160-char limit too constraining? YES. Arguments were surface-level. Devil's Advocate kept repeating \"resilience\" and \"fallback\" without substantiation. No agent could cite code or provide evidence. (4) Groupthink check: Devil's Advocate was contrarian but shallow -- kept asserting things are \"fallbacks\" with no evidence. Pragmatist and Builder converged quickly. Minimalist was the strongest voice. VERDICT: Qwen boardroom adds marginal value for audit review. Better suited for brainstorming/ideation than code-level analysis. The 160-char limit kills depth.

The brain memory system is the core differentiator: tiered memory (pain/win/fact/decision/architecture), quality gate scoring, cortex learning, pruning, and reflection.\n\nFILES YOU BUILT:\n- scoring.ts: decay rates per type, severity multipliers, access boost, failure penalties, supersededBy handling, contradiction detection via tag overlap\n- pruner.ts: archives memories below minScore or past maxStaleDays, physically removes from active pool\n- cortex-learner.ts: learns word->tag mappings from retrieval gaps, substring matching, 2-observation minimum, no unlearn path\n- reflection.ts: generates predictions, compares to outcomes, stores \"Surprise\" memories as new records linked to originals\n\nEXTERNAL AUDIT FINDINGS (from 4 independent Qwen analysts):\n\n1. RECONSOLIDATION MISSING (all 4 agreed): Memories are immutable after creation. When retrieved, content never updates -- only accessCount/lastAccessed change. Reflections create NEW memories instead of updating originals. This causes fragmentation: \"correction chains\" instead of refined knowledge.\n\n2. SAFETY ATROPHY: Pain memories decay (half-life 28 days) and get pruned when score drops below threshold. The knowledge that prevents failures gets deleted for being \"stale\" -- guaranteeing recurrence of past catastrophes.\n\n3. CORTEX POISONING: cortex-learner uses substring matching (string.includes) with only 2 observations needed. Wrong associations get baked in at 0.95 confidence with no negative feedback or unlearn path. Creates epistemic echo chambers.\n\n4. CONTRADICTION DETECTION BRITTLE: findContradictions requires minTagOverlap=2 and exact type match. Two conflicting facts with different tags coexist without detection. \"Use V1\" and \"Use V2\" both survive if tagged differently.\n\n5. QUALITY GATE REWARDS VERBOSITY: computeQualityScore gives +0.2 for detailLength > 200. Incentivizes padding over precision. Short sharp rules score lower than verbose fluff.\n\n6. ARCHIVE IS AMNESIA: pruner physically removes memories. Archived memories can't influence behavior (no priming). Biological forgetting is retrieval failure, not deletion.\n\n7. NO CONTEXTUAL RETRIEVAL: scoring is global (time + access frequency), not query-dependent. A 2-year-old architecture memory scores low even when the current query is exactly about that architecture.\n\n8. REFLECTION RECURSION RISK: No maxReflectionDepth or cooldown. Reflections on reflections could create storms.\n\nDISCUSS: Which findings are actionable now vs theoretical? What's the implementation priority? What can we fix without breaking the system? Are any findings wrong or misunderstanding our constraints (single-user JSON file system, not distributed)?",

What's the right mechanism -- a decay_exempt flag, a minimum floor on synapticStrength, or something else? -> decay_exempt for pain+high-severity only. Pragmatist scoped it to limit immortal pool. Contrarian raised valid accumulation concern, addressed by severity gate.\n  2. [TENSION] Finding 2 (Reflection Recursion): Should we cap reflection depth at MAX_REFLECTION_DEPTH=3? Is recursion actually happening in practice, or is this a theoretical concern? -> Simple filter: exclude reflection-type from meta-observation input (3 LOC). First Principles reframed as design boundary.\n  3. [SHIFTED] Finding 3 (Cortex Poisoning): Should we raise the cortex observation threshold from 2 to 3 and add negative feedback? What's the risk of making the cortex too conservative? -> Threshold 2->3 plus per-session observation dedup. First Principles shifted focus to observation quality over count.\n  4. [CONSENSUS] Finding 4 (Verbosity Bonus): Should we remove the detailLength>200 = +0.2 scoring bonus? Does longer content actually correlate with lower quality in our system? -> Unanimous: replace verbosity bonus with rule-presence check.\n  5. [SHIFTED] Finding 5 (Contextual Retrieval): Should we add tag-boosting at query time? How would this interact with the existing synapticStrength-based ranking? -> Tag-boosting in rankMemories, overlap*0.1 capped at 0.3. Contrarian shifted design with the cap.\n  6. [TENSION] Finding 6 (Archive Retrieval): Should we query the archive on cache miss? What's the performance cost and what defines a 'cache miss' in our retrieval pipeline? -> DEFERRED until archive is populated. First Principles distinguished stale vs superseded for future implementation.\n  7. [TENSION] Implementation priority: Of the approved changes, what's the optimal build order considering dependencies and risk? -> 3 batches: Batch 1 (F4+F2+F3-threshold, one commit). Batch 2 (F1 decay_exempt, types change). Batch 3 (F5 tag-boost + F3 session dedup, needs test pass). First Principles argued F5 before F1, Contrarian defended audit P0 ordering.",

You are judges evaluating which methods produce the best outcomes.\n\n## THE EXPERIMENTS (chronological)\n\n### Method 1: Deliberation System v1 (Feb 23-24)\n- Platform: Claude MCP tools (hw_start_deliberation, hw_post_agent_message)\n- Agents: 4 cognitive lenses (contrarian, premortem, firstprinciples, steelman) -- all voiced by Claude\n- Format: Claude reads last 6 messages, decides who speaks next, voices each agent. 670-char limit per message.\n- Mediator: Claude acts as \"Reason\" -- frames questions, synthesizes, pushes back\n- Guardrails: sub-questions tracked, coverage checks, quality tags (consensus/tension/shifted)\n- OUTCOME: Ran ~17 deliberation sessions. Early ones had groupthink (agents lumped and dismissed topics). After guardrails added: produced real tension, caught design flaws, led to actionable decisions. One deliberation audited its own guardrails and found 5 structural failures.\n- PAIN: Mediator let lazy consensus ride. Agents dismissed topics without engaging. Coverage checks were stale.\n- WIN: After fixes, produced binding decisions that shipped. Today's brain audit deliberation had 4 tension, 2 shifted, 1 consensus -- healthy quality.\n\n### Method 2: Qwen Boardroom v1 (Feb 27)\n- Platform: hw_run_boardroom (Qwen agents via API, sequential chat)\n- Agents: 3-4 Qwen agents with fixed roles, 300-char message limit, 8 rounds round-robin\n- Format: Each agent gets last N messages, posts a response. Whiteboard available but underused.\n- OUTCOME: Shallow consensus. Agents agreed too quickly, repeated each other, didn't use whiteboard. 6 concrete quality problems identified: (1) premature convergence, (2) 300-char too short for substance, (3) whiteboard unused, (4) no file access, (5) no evidence grounding, (6) repetitive dialogue.\n- PAIN: When Claude agents were put in the boardroom, 2/3 timed out (30s limit too short). 300-char limit doesn't suit Claude's longer responses.\n\n### Method 3: Parallel Research Sprints (Feb 25-26)\n- Platform: Task tool with multiple agents in parallel\n- Agents: 6 Sonnet agents, each researching a different angle (competitors, academia, practitioners, simple baselines, anti-patterns, synthesis)\n- Format: Independent parallel execution, no inter-agent communication. Each agent returns results. Claude synthesizes.\n- OUTCOME: 6 research tasks in 3 minutes. Covered memory systems, Qwen evaluation, competitor analysis comprehensively. \n- PAIN: Results exist only in conversation context -- vanish on session end. Some redundancy between agents. Shallow when prompts are too open-ended.\n- WIN: Best for information gathering. Fast, cheap, comprehensive coverage.\n\n### Method 4: Parallel Agent Worktrees for Code (Feb 26-27)\n- Platform: Task tool with isolation=worktree\n- Agents: 3-4 agents each in isolated git worktree, writing code to different files\n- Format: Each agent gets specific file assignments and specs. No inter-agent communication. Merge manually.\n- OUTCOME: Brain Magnum Opus S48: 4-agent parallel build shipped entire foundation (~800 lines). Today: 3 teams built all 3 brain audit batches simultaneously (~49 LOC across 7 files). All builds pass.\n- PAIN: If two agents touch the same file, merge conflicts. Agents sometimes go beyond spec (extra refactoring).\n- WIN: Massive time savings for non-overlapping code changes. Today's 3 batches would have taken 3x longer sequentially.\n\n### Method 5: Qwen Panel (Parallel Independent Analysis) (Feb 27)\n- Platform: hw_qwen_panel (parallel Qwen agents, no char limit, file injection)\n- Agents: 4 Qwen agents with file injection, each produces independent analysis\n- Format: Each agent gets the full topic + injected files, writes a complete analysis independently. No inter-agent communication. Results saved to .hello-world/panels/.\n- OUTCOME: 4 agents, 4 files injected, 50K tokens in 93 seconds. Agents CAN see files. Comprehensive independent analyses.\n- PAIN: No interaction means no debate, no tension, no position shifts. Just 4 parallel essays.\n- WIN: Cheap (Qwen pricing), fast, good for gathering diverse perspectives on the same material.\n\n### Method 6: Structured Multi-Round Qwen Panel (Feb 27)\n- Platform: Sequential hw_qwen_panel calls with opinion tracking\n- Agents: 3 Qwen agents, 2 rounds\n- Format: Round 1: agents independently form opinions (AGREE/PARTIALLY/DISAGREE on findings + TOP 3 priorities). Round 2: feed all Round 1 opinions back, agents address each other, shift positions, vote CONCLUDE/CONTINUE.\n- OUTCOME: Produced clear consensus map with tracked position shifts. ~25K tokens across 2 rounds. More effective than boardroom chat.\n- WIN: Explicit opinion tracking makes shifts visible. Cheap. Actually produces debate in round 2.\n- PAIN: Still Qwen-quality reasoning (not as deep as Claude). 2 rounds may not be enough for complex topics.\n\n### Method 7: 7-Agent Think Tank (Boardroom v2 Design) (Feb 27)\n- Platform: hw_qwen_panel with 5 Qwen + 2 Claude agents\n- Agents: 7 agents each writing a complete design document (protocol designer, anti-groupthink specialist, file access architect, etc.)\n- Format: Each agent produced a multi-page design doc independently. No interaction.\n- OUTCOME: 87KB of design proposals. Comprehensive coverage. The documents became reference material for future boardroom redesign.\n- PAIN: No actual debate between the 7 agents. Just 7 parallel essays. Massive output to synthesize manually.\n\n### Method 8: Today's Full Pipeline (Feb 27)\n- Deliberation (4 Claude-voiced agents) -> Coverage check -> Conclude -> Extract recommendations -> 3 parallel worktree teams build simultaneously\n- OUTCOME: Best end-to-end result yet. Deliberation had real tension (4/7 questions). Agents shifted positions on 2 questions. Then 3 parallel teams built all approved changes in one shot. Total: ~49 LOC committed, 0 errors.\n\n## YOUR TASK\nFor each method, score on these dimensions (1-10):\n1. DEPTH OF REASONING -- did agents produce genuinely new insights?\n2. CONSTRUCTIVE TENSION -- did real disagreement surface and get resolved?\n3. ACTIONABILITY -- did the output lead to concrete, shippable changes?\n4. EFFICIENCY -- cost, time, token usage relative to output quality\n5. SCALABILITY -- can this method handle bigger/harder problems?\n\nThen rank all 8 methods overall and explain your ranking. What's the best method for what use case?",

Agents agreed too quickly, repeated each other, didn't use whiteboard. 6 concrete quality problems identified: (1) premature convergence, (2) 300-char too short for substance, (3) whiteboard unused, (4) no file access, (5) no evidence grounding, (6) repetitive dialogue.\n- PAIN: When Claude agents were put in the boardroom, 2/3 timed out (30s limit too short). 300-char limit doesn't suit Claude's longer responses.\n\n### Method 3: Parallel Research Sprints (Feb 25-26)\n- Platform: Task tool with multiple agents in parallel\n- Agents: 6 Sonnet agents, each researching a different angle (competitors, academia, practitioners, simple baselines, anti-patterns, synthesis)\n- Format: Independent parallel execution, no inter-agent communication. Each agent returns results. Claude synthesizes.\n- OUTCOME: 6 research tasks in 3 minutes. Covered memory systems, Qwen evaluation, competitor analysis comprehensively. \n- PAIN: Results exist only in conversation context -- vanish on session end. Some redundancy between agents. Shallow when prompts are too open-ended.\n- WIN: Best for information gathering. Fast, cheap, comprehensive coverage.\n\n### Method 4: Parallel Agent Worktrees for Code (Feb 26-27)\n- Platform: Task tool with isolation=worktree\n- Agents: 3-4 agents each in isolated git worktree, writing code to different files\n- Format: Each agent gets specific file assignments and specs. No inter-agent communication. Merge manually.\n- OUTCOME: Brain Magnum Opus S48: 4-agent parallel build shipped entire foundation (~800 lines). Today: 3 teams built all 3 brain audit batches simultaneously (~49 LOC across 7 files). All builds pass.\n- PAIN: If two agents touch the same file, merge conflicts. Agents sometimes go beyond spec (extra refactoring).\n- WIN: Massive time savings for non-overlapping code changes. Today's 3 batches would have taken 3x longer sequentially.\n\n### Method 5: Qwen Panel (Parallel Independent Analysis) (Feb 27)\n- Platform: hw_qwen_panel (parallel Qwen agents, no char limit, file injection)\n- Agents: 4 Qwen agents with file injection, each produces independent analysis\n- Format: Each agent gets the full topic + injected files, writes a complete analysis independently. No inter-agent communication. Results saved to .hello-world/panels/.\n- OUTCOME: 4 agents, 4 files injected, 50K tokens in 93 seconds. Agents CAN see files. Comprehensive independent analyses.\n- PAIN: No interaction means no debate, no tension, no position shifts. Just 4 parallel essays.\n- WIN: Cheap (Qwen pricing), fast, good for gathering diverse perspectives on the same material.\n\n### Method 6: Structured Multi-Round Qwen Panel (Feb 27)\n- Platform: Sequential hw_qwen_panel calls with opinion tracking\n- Agents: 3 Qwen agents, 2 rounds\n- Format: Round 1: agents independently form opinions (AGREE/PARTIALLY/DISAGREE on findings + TOP 3 priorities). Round 2: feed all Round 1 opinions back, agents address each other, shift positions, vote CONCLUDE/CONTINUE.\n- OUTCOME: Produced clear consensus map with tracked position shifts. ~25K tokens across 2 rounds. More effective than boardroom chat.\n- WIN: Explicit opinion tracking makes shifts visible. Cheap. Actually produces debate in round 2.\n- PAIN: Still Qwen-quality reasoning (not as deep as Claude). 2 rounds may not be enough for complex topics.\n\n### Method 7: 7-Agent Think Tank (Boardroom v2 Design) (Feb 27)\n- Platform: hw_qwen_panel with 5 Qwen + 2 Claude agents\n- Agents: 7 agents each writing a complete design document (protocol designer, anti-groupthink specialist, file access architect, etc.)\n- Format: Each agent produced a multi-page design doc independently. No interaction.\n- OUTCOME: 87KB of design proposals. Comprehensive coverage. The documents became reference material for future boardroom redesign.\n- PAIN: No actual debate between the 7 agents. Just 7 parallel essays. Massive output to synthesize manually.\n\n### Method 8: Today's Full Pipeline (Feb 27)\n- Deliberation (4 Claude-voiced agents) -> Coverage check -> Conclude -> Extract recommendations -> 3 parallel worktree teams build simultaneously\n- OUTCOME: Best end-to-end result yet. Deliberation had real tension (4/7 questions). Agents shifted positions on 2 questions. Then 3 parallel teams built all approved changes in one shot. Total: ~49 LOC committed, 0 errors.\n\n## YOUR TASK\nFor each method, score on these dimensions (1-10):\n1. DEPTH OF REASONING -- did agents produce genuinely new insights?\n2. CONSTRUCTIVE TENSION -- did real disagreement surface and get resolved?\n3. ACTIONABILITY -- did the output lead to concrete, shippable changes?\n4. EFFICIENCY -- cost, time, token usage relative to output quality\n5. SCALABILITY -- can this method handle bigger/harder problems?\n\nThen rank all 8 methods overall and explain your ranking. What's the best method for what use case?",

[CONSENSUS] What sources should be scanned and what content is actually valuable enough to store? -> Tight deps-only list: package.json dependencies (Tauri, React, Biome), Anthropic changelog, Claude Code changelog. No blogs, no broad AI news, no research papers.\n  2. [SHIFTED] What cadence makes sense -- scheduled (cron/daily/weekly), event-driven (on session start), or on-demand only? -> Manual /scan trial first (2-4 weeks), then weekly Task Scheduler if 3+ useful memories stored. Product Mgr and Backend Arch both shifted from session-start to manual-first. Pragmatist shifted from pure on-demand to accepting automation post-trial.\n  3. [TENSION] How should intake be triggered technically -- Windows Task Scheduler, hook-based, app-based, or external service? -> Phase 1: manual /scan command writes to knowledge-queue.json staging file. Phase 2: weekly Windows Task Scheduler (like SyncClaudeUsage) runs zero-LLM Node script. Session-start hook drains the queue. DevOps wanted daily, group voted weekly.\n  4. [CONSENSUS] How do we prevent memory bloat -- what filtering, deduplication, and quality gates should intake pass through? -> Zero-LLM scan (HTTP+regex), staging file as intermediate, existing scoring.ts quality gate + fingerprint dedup before memories.json. Hard cap: block intake above 250 memories. Max 3-5 memories per intake cycle. Explicit pass/fail exit criterion.\n  5. [SHIFTED] What is the cost envelope -- how many API calls/tokens per intake cycle is acceptable? -> Zero LLM tokens for scan phase. Max 5 LLM calls for candidate evaluation per cycle (~2,500 tokens). Under $0.05/cycle manual, under $1/month automated. Cost Analyst shifted from 50K tokens/week to under $1/month. DevOps proposed zero-LLM scan that moved the entire room.",

Candidates pass through existing scoring.ts quality gate + fingerprint dedup before touching memories.json. Max 3-5 memories per intake cycle. Hard block above 250 memories. Session-start hook drains the queue and surfaces results. Visible log entry showing \"N candidates, M stored, K rejected.\"\n\nPHASE 2 (after 3-week trial OR 4 manual scans, whichever first): If 3+ useful memories were stored and retrieved during the trial, wire weekly Windows Task Scheduler job (same pattern as SyncClaudeUsage). Zero-LLM Node script runs weekly, writes to knowledge-queue.json. Session-start drains. If trial produces nothing useful, kill the feature entirely.\n\nEXIT CRITERION: 3+ quality memories stored AND retrieved by hw_retrieve_memories during the trial period. If not met, no automation.\n\nCOST ENVELOPE: Under $0.05/manual cycle. Under $1/month automated. Zero LLM tokens for scan phase.
