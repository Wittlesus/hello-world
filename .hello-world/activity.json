      "details": "Quality: 2 tension, 1 shifted, 3 consensus\n  1. [TENSION] Is the race condition actually causing data loss in practice, or is it theoretical? What evidence do we have? -> No confirmed data loss incidents but silent corruption is undetectable by design. Pragmatist challenged evidence, Security argued absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n  2. [SHIFTED] File locking (quick fix) vs SQLite (proper fix) vs splitting state.json into separate files per concern -- which approach gives the best effort/payoff ratio RIGHT NOW? -> B+ (split files + atomic writes + backup). Backendarch shifted from SQLite-leaning to B+ after Pragmatist's multi-project timing argument and MSVC compilation concern.\n  3. [TENSION] If SQLite: how do we maintain the file-watcher reactivity pattern that powers live UI updates? SQLite changes don't emit filesystem events the same way JSON writes do. -> Security proposed WAL file watching or trigger file pattern. Pragmatist countered that the total SQLite migration is still 2-3 days regardless. Moot for now since SQLite deferred.\n  4. [CONSENSUS] If SQLite: what's the migration path? Big bang rewrite or incremental (one data type at a time)? -> SQLite migration deferred to multi-project epic. Not needed now.\n  5. [CONSENSUS] What happens to the session-start hook, which currently reads raw JSON files? Does it need to talk to SQLite directly or go through the MCP server? -> Session-start hook reads 4 files instead of 1. Actually cleaner -- partial corruption gives partial context instead of total failure. Health check already added.\n  6. [CONSENSUS] Multi-project is coming (t_mp_epic). Does the storage decision change if each project has its own database vs shared global state? -> Split files are forward-compatible with multi-project. Each project gets own directory with own files. Global state already lives in memory/ directory.",

Session-start hook reads split files with .backup fallback on parse failure. SQLite deferred to multi-project architecture deliberation.

Shared polling: Replace per-hook 10s intervals in useTauriData.ts with a single global 30s heartbeat that deduplicates\n4. File watcher debounce: When MCP writes 3 files rapidly, batch the watcher events so components re-render once, not 3 times\n5. Verify all hooks work with split files: session-start, pre-tool-gate, user-prompt-submit, post-edit-context\n6.

      "description": "All 7 sub-questions addressed",
      "details": "Quality: 4 tension, 2 shifted, 1 consensus\n  1. [TENSION] What is the canonical Memory schema? Which new fields are essential (links, reflections, qualityScore, fingerprint, supersededBy) and which are overengineering? What's the minimal schema that supports linking, scoring, dedup, and conflict resolution? -> Schema adds: links[], supersededBy, qualityScore, fingerprint (all optional). New type enum: reflection. Optional reflection fields: relatedTaskId, surfacedMemoryIds, outcome.\n  2. [TENSION] What is the complete retrieval pipeline from 'user types message' to 'brain injects context'? How do scoring.ts, cortex learning, link traversal, and context phase integrate into one flow? Where does each team's contribution slot in? -> 11-stage pipeline: tokenize, attention, cortex load (merged), pattern recognition, associative chaining, link traversal (0.8/0.6/0.4 weights), amygdala * scoreMemory * synapticStrength, rank with context phase, forced pain-win pairing via resolves links, dopamine, hot tags. Telemetry on every retrieval.\n  3. [SHIFTED] How does the brain learn from outcomes? Design the complete feedback loop: memory surfaced -> task outcome -> strength adjustment -> rule derivation. How do Reflexion-style reflections, Hebbian plasticity, and engineering effectiveness tracking combine into one system? -> Complete feedback loop: surfaced -> activeTraces -> task completion -> reflection (template-based) -> outcome-based plasticity (+0.15 success, -0.05 failure) -> after 3+ reflections same tags -> derive learned rule -> confidence scoring -> CLAUDE.md promotion at 0.9+. Prediction-error principle for auto-capture.\n  4. [SHIFTED] What enters the brain automatically vs manually? Design quality gates, dedup rules, and the prediction-error principle. How do we prevent auto-capture noise (71 of 193 memories are low-quality auto-captured) while still capturing important events? -> Three-gate quality system: qualityScore at write (reject < 0.15), fingerprint dedup (block exact, warn near), conflict resolution (ADD/MERGE/INVALIDATE/SKIP). Auto-capture uses prediction-error: only store unexpected outcomes. Expected success = just boost, novel success = capture, failure despite warnings = capture reflection.\n  5. [CONSENSUS] How does the brain self-evolve? Design cortex learning (auto-expand keyword map), procedural memory (learned rules from patterns), and automated archival/pruning. What self-evolves vs what stays manual? Where is the automation boundary? -> Three self-evolution systems: (1) cortex learning from retrieval gaps + memory title mining at PreCompact, (2) automated pruning at session end (stale + zero-access + 60d = archive), (3) learned rules derived from reflection patterns with confidence scoring. Cortex-learned.json, learned-rules.json, memories-archive.json.\n  6. [TENSION] How do we enforce brain signals so Claude can't ignore them? Design the three-layer enforcement: signal (hook output format), gate (PreToolUse blocks), instruction (CLAUDE.md rules). What's mandatory vs advisory? -> Three-layer enforcement: signal (hook prefixes [ATTENTION GATE], [CRITICAL PAIN], [LEARNED RULE]), gate (PreToolUse blocks Edit/Write when smart checkpoint triggers -- significantEvents >= 3 AND interval exceeded), instruction (CLAUDE.md rules). Brain health observability via hw_brain_health tool + memory-metrics.json.\n  7. [TENSION] What is the phased execution plan? Map every feature to a specific phase, identify dependencies, and define what ships in session 48 vs 49 vs 50+. What's the minimum viable brain that delivers real learning, and what layers on top? -> 4-session phased execution. S48: migration script + unify systems + wire engine + scoring + plasticity (~800 lines). S49: quality gates + reflections + linking (~600 lines). S50: cortex learning + pruning + rules (~500 lines). S51: enforcement + observability + flowchart (~300 lines). Total ~2200 lines across 4 new files + modifications to ~10 existing files.",

Key findings: (1) Industry converges on plain markdown for CODING memory, but our use case is broader -- persistent relational memory across sessions. (2) Quality gates and pruning are research-proven essential (Xiong et al.: indiscriminate storage degrades agents by 10%). (3) Our linker aligns with A-MEM Zettelkasten approach (superior results on 6 models). (4) Plasticity/decay aligns with MemoryBank and Mnemosyne (both show improvements). (5) Rules extraction is memory consolidation (episodic to semantic), theoretically sound. (6) 52 sessions is barely a warm-up -- benchmarks run hundreds of interactions. (7) Letta found plain filesystem beat Mem0 graph on LoCoMo (74% vs 68.5%) but this measures coding context, not long-term relationship memory.",

Tauri's file watcher detected the change, triggered a Rust recompile, killed the app process, which killed the PTY and Claude Code. 23-second gap between death and restart matches Rust compile time.

Key findings: Qwen is 14-66x cheaper than Claude, competitive on single-file tasks, but fails on advanced TypeScript (1/10 vs Claude 8/10), multi-file coordination, instruction following, and multi-turn semantic drift. System prompt adherence is a known weakness. Tool calling breaks on local 30B. Integration is drop-in via OpenAI npm package -- add provider field to AgentDefinition. Best providers: DeepInfra ($0.07/M), DashScope ($0.10/M). Recommended pattern: Claude orchestrates + reviews, Qwen executes narrow well-specified tasks with biome+tsc validation gate after every output.",
