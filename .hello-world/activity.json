Tax law data verified correct (Section 25D expired, 48E active for leases, July 4 2026 safe harbor deadline). Competitive gap confirmed -- no clean neutral interactive calculator exists for post-OBBBA decisions. Business model: free interactive calculators + SEO content + solar installer/CPA lead gen referrals ($50-200/lead). Moat: domain authority + interactive complexity AI overviews can't replicate + fastest updates when legislation changes. Key risks: Google AI overviews eating simple queries (mitigate with branching multi-step tools), credits can be legislated away (mitigate by expanding to all credit types as a platform). Immediate next steps: (1) verify all 50 state credit amounts against DSIRE database, (2) redesign the calculator with modern clean UI, (3) deploy to the domain, (4) write supporting SEO content targeting \"solar lease vs buy 2026\" keywords, (5) set up referral partnerships with solar installers.",

Should coverage checking be hard-blocking (can't conclude) or advisory (warn but allow)? -> Coverage should upgrade from binary (addressed/not) to qualitative (consensus/tension/shifted). Hard-block in full mode, advisory in quick mode.\n  4. Is the approval gate on hw_plan_deliberation too heavy for low-stakes deliberations? -> Too heavy for low-stakes. Two tiers: quick (no plan/approval) and full (current flow). Mediator auto-detects, user can override.\n  5. What failure modes exist that the current guardrails don't catch (e.g., groupthink, shallow agreement)? -> Checkbox theater -- agents 'address' questions without real engagement. Fix: track tension vs consensus per sub-question. All-consensus is a red flag.\n  6. From the app UI side: does the guardrails structure (sub-questions, coverage) improve how Pat reads and acts on deliberation output? -> Sub-questions improve scannability of output for Pat. Coverage tags (tension/consensus) tell Pat where to focus. Machinery should be invisible -- Pat sees structured summary, not the process.\n  7. For a first-time user, is the deliberation flow (plan -> approve -> run -> coverage -> conclude -> extract) understandable or overwhelming? -> 7-step flow is overwhelming for new users. Quick mode removes plan+approve+coverage steps. Quick recommendations return as bulk-dismissable insights, not individual approvals.",

What evidence do we have? -> No confirmed data loss incidents but silent corruption is undetectable by design. Pragmatist challenged evidence, Security argued absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n  2. [SHIFTED] File locking (quick fix) vs SQLite (proper fix) vs splitting state.json into separate files per concern -- which approach gives the best effort/payoff ratio RIGHT NOW? -> B+ (split files + atomic writes + backup). Backendarch shifted from SQLite-leaning to B+ after Pragmatist's multi-project timing argument and MSVC compilation concern.\n  3. [TENSION] If SQLite: how do we maintain the file-watcher reactivity pattern that powers live UI updates? SQLite changes don't emit filesystem events the same way JSON writes do. -> Security proposed WAL file watching or trigger file pattern. Pragmatist countered that the total SQLite migration is still 2-3 days regardless. Moot for now since SQLite deferred.\n  4. [CONSENSUS] If SQLite: what's the migration path? Big bang rewrite or incremental (one data type at a time)? -> SQLite migration deferred to multi-project epic. Not needed now.\n  5. [CONSENSUS] What happens to the session-start hook, which currently reads raw JSON files? Does it need to talk to SQLite directly or go through the MCP server? -> Session-start hook reads 4 files instead of 1. Actually cleaner -- partial corruption gives partial context instead of total failure. Health check already added.\n  6. [CONSENSUS] Multi-project is coming (t_mp_epic). Does the storage decision change if each project has its own database vs shared global state? -> Split files are forward-compatible with multi-project. Each project gets own directory with own files. Global state already lives in memory/ directory.",

Shared polling: Replace per-hook 10s intervals in useTauriData.ts with a single global 30s heartbeat that deduplicates\n4. File watcher debounce: When MCP writes 3 files rapidly, batch the watcher events so components re-render once, not 3 times\n5. Verify all hooks work with split files: session-start, pre-tool-gate, user-prompt-submit, post-edit-context\n6. Test the full flow end-to-end\n\nThis is cleanup debt from the B+ state storage decision. Should have been caught during the original migration.",
