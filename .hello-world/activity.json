      "details": "Quality: 4 tension, 2 shifted, 1 consensus\n  1. [TENSION] What is the canonical Memory schema? Which new fields are essential (links, reflections, qualityScore, fingerprint, supersededBy) and which are overengineering? What's the minimal schema that supports linking, scoring, dedup, and conflict resolution? -> Schema adds: links[], supersededBy, qualityScore, fingerprint (all optional). New type enum: reflection. Optional reflection fields: relatedTaskId, surfacedMemoryIds, outcome.\n  2. [TENSION] What is the complete retrieval pipeline from 'user types message' to 'brain injects context'? How do scoring.ts, cortex learning, link traversal, and context phase integrate into one flow? Where does each team's contribution slot in? -> 11-stage pipeline: tokenize, attention, cortex load (merged), pattern recognition, associative chaining, link traversal (0.8/0.6/0.4 weights), amygdala * scoreMemory * synapticStrength, rank with context phase, forced pain-win pairing via resolves links, dopamine, hot tags. Telemetry on every retrieval.\n  3. [SHIFTED] How does the brain learn from outcomes? Design the complete feedback loop: memory surfaced -> task outcome -> strength adjustment -> rule derivation. How do Reflexion-style reflections, Hebbian plasticity, and engineering effectiveness tracking combine into one system? -> Complete feedback loop: surfaced -> activeTraces -> task completion -> reflection (template-based) -> outcome-based plasticity (+0.15 success, -0.05 failure) -> after 3+ reflections same tags -> derive learned rule -> confidence scoring -> CLAUDE.md promotion at 0.9+. Prediction-error principle for auto-capture.\n  4. [SHIFTED] What enters the brain automatically vs manually? Design quality gates, dedup rules, and the prediction-error principle. How do we prevent auto-capture noise (71 of 193 memories are low-quality auto-captured) while still capturing important events? -> Three-gate quality system: qualityScore at write (reject < 0.15), fingerprint dedup (block exact, warn near), conflict resolution (ADD/MERGE/INVALIDATE/SKIP). Auto-capture uses prediction-error: only store unexpected outcomes. Expected success = just boost, novel success = capture, failure despite warnings = capture reflection.\n  5. [CONSENSUS] How does the brain self-evolve? Design cortex learning (auto-expand keyword map), procedural memory (learned rules from patterns), and automated archival/pruning. What self-evolves vs what stays manual? Where is the automation boundary? -> Three self-evolution systems: (1) cortex learning from retrieval gaps + memory title mining at PreCompact, (2) automated pruning at session end (stale + zero-access + 60d = archive), (3) learned rules derived from reflection patterns with confidence scoring. Cortex-learned.json, learned-rules.json, memories-archive.json.\n  6. [TENSION] How do we enforce brain signals so Claude can't ignore them? Design the three-layer enforcement: signal (hook output format), gate (PreToolUse blocks), instruction (CLAUDE.md rules). What's mandatory vs advisory? -> Three-layer enforcement: signal (hook prefixes [ATTENTION GATE], [CRITICAL PAIN], [LEARNED RULE]), gate (PreToolUse blocks Edit/Write when smart checkpoint triggers -- significantEvents >= 3 AND interval exceeded), instruction (CLAUDE.md rules). Brain health observability via hw_brain_health tool + memory-metrics.json.\n  7. [TENSION] What is the phased execution plan? Map every feature to a specific phase, identify dependencies, and define what ships in session 48 vs 49 vs 50+. What's the minimum viable brain that delivers real learning, and what layers on top? -> 4-session phased execution. S48: migration script + unify systems + wire engine + scoring + plasticity (~800 lines). S49: quality gates + reflections + linking (~600 lines). S50: cortex learning + pruning + rules (~500 lines). S51: enforcement + observability + flowchart (~300 lines). Total ~2200 lines across 4 new files + modifications to ~10 existing files.",

Results: (1) Did Qwen find anything Claude didn't? NO. No new bugs or issues surfaced. Devil's Advocate's \"state.json is a fail-safe\" claim was wrong -- it's genuinely a dead file read. (2) Did Qwen change priority ordering? PARTIALLY. Pragmatist's \"comment-out don't delete\" for brain engines is a reasonable middle ground Claude didn't propose. Builder pushed for \"verify before purge\" which is cautious but valid. (3) Was 160-char limit too constraining? YES. Arguments were surface-level. Devil's Advocate kept repeating \"resilience\" and \"fallback\" without substantiation. No agent could cite code or provide evidence. (4) Groupthink check: Devil's Advocate was contrarian but shallow -- kept asserting things are \"fallbacks\" with no evidence. Pragmatist and Builder converged quickly. Minimalist was the strongest voice. VERDICT: Qwen boardroom adds marginal value for audit review. Better suited for brainstorming/ideation than code-level analysis. The 160-char limit kills depth.

Full designs saved at .hello-world/shared-files/boardroom-v2-thinktank.md (75KB).

The brain memory system is the core differentiator: tiered memory (pain/win/fact/decision/architecture), quality gate scoring, cortex learning, pruning, and reflection.\n\nFILES YOU BUILT:\n- scoring.ts: decay rates per type, severity multipliers, access boost, failure penalties, supersededBy handling, contradiction detection via tag overlap\n- pruner.ts: archives memories below minScore or past maxStaleDays, physically removes from active pool\n- cortex-learner.ts: learns word->tag mappings from retrieval gaps, substring matching, 2-observation minimum, no unlearn path\n- reflection.ts: generates predictions, compares to outcomes, stores \"Surprise\" memories as new records linked to originals\n\nEXTERNAL AUDIT FINDINGS (from 4 independent Qwen analysts):\n\n1. RECONSOLIDATION MISSING (all 4 agreed): Memories are immutable after creation. When retrieved, content never updates -- only accessCount/lastAccessed change. Reflections create NEW memories instead of updating originals. This causes fragmentation: \"correction chains\" instead of refined knowledge.\n\n2. SAFETY ATROPHY: Pain memories decay (half-life 28 days) and get pruned when score drops below threshold. The knowledge that prevents failures gets deleted for being \"stale\" -- guaranteeing recurrence of past catastrophes.\n\n3. CORTEX POISONING: cortex-learner uses substring matching (string.includes) with only 2 observations needed. Wrong associations get baked in at 0.95 confidence with no negative feedback or unlearn path. Creates epistemic echo chambers.\n\n4. CONTRADICTION DETECTION BRITTLE: findContradictions requires minTagOverlap=2 and exact type match. Two conflicting facts with different tags coexist without detection. \"Use V1\" and \"Use V2\" both survive if tagged differently.\n\n5. QUALITY GATE REWARDS VERBOSITY: computeQualityScore gives +0.2 for detailLength > 200. Incentivizes padding over precision. Short sharp rules score lower than verbose fluff.\n\n6. ARCHIVE IS AMNESIA: pruner physically removes memories. Archived memories can't influence behavior (no priming). Biological forgetting is retrieval failure, not deletion.\n\n7. NO CONTEXTUAL RETRIEVAL: scoring is global (time + access frequency), not query-dependent. A 2-year-old architecture memory scores low even when the current query is exactly about that architecture.\n\n8. REFLECTION RECURSION RISK: No maxReflectionDepth or cooldown. Reflections on reflections could create storms.\n\nDISCUSS: Which findings are actionable now vs theoretical? What's the implementation priority? What can we fix without breaking the system? Are any findings wrong or misunderstanding our constraints (single-user JSON file system, not distributed)?",

Unanimous findings: (1) Safety Atrophy is P0 -- pain memories decay and get pruned, add decay_exempt flag. (2) Reflection recursion needs MAX_REFLECTION_DEPTH=3. (3) Cortex poisoning -- raise observation threshold 2->3, add negative feedback. (4) Remove verbosity bonus (detailLength>200 = +0.2). (5) Contextual retrieval -- add tag-boosting at query time. (6) Archive retrieval -- query archive on cache miss. Disagreements: contradiction detection (2 say over-engineering, 1 says needed), reconsolidation (all say partially needed but immutability has value for JSON safety).",
